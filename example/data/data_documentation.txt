## Data in the pickle file:

seq_file: path and name of the simulated sequence file

B0: field strength [T]
gamma: gyromagnetic ratio [rad/uT]
scale: scale factor for initial magnetization vector

phantom: (each arrays of values for each voxel location, *are optional)
  t1: T1 times [s]
  t2: T2 times [s]
  b0_shift: field shift in ppm
  b1_inhom: relative B1 inhomogeneity
  *fractions: fraction sizes (relative to water)
  *noise: optional noise

sim_locs: list of locations (tuples) in the phantom where data is stored

phantom_sim: simulated phantoms (arrays for each offset)

z_specs: Z-spectra at each simulated voxel

offsets: simulated offsets
