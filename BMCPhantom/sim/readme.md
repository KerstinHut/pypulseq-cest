# Cross-simulation-tool functionality
The code in this folder ensures the cross-tool functionality by providing a parameter class in the [params](params.py)
file to be passed on to the BMCSim tool or parsed into C++ for SimPulseqSBB. It also provides evaluation tools in the
[eval](eval.py) for plotting and calculations of the simulated magnetizations.
