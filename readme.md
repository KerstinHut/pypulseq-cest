# PyPulseq-CEST: Simulation tool and seq-file preparation for CEST saturation blocks

This repository contains the code and tools to build CEST saturation blocks with 
[pypulseq](https://github.com/imr-framework/pypulseq), which is a python adaption of the matlab-based 
[pulseq](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq) project. 
Please visit [https://pulseq-cest.github.io/](https://pulseq-cest.github.io/) for more information on the pulseq-cest 
project. The documentation of the **pulseq** open file format for MR sequences can be found 
[here](https://pulseq.github.io/specification.pdf). Pulseq-cest specific seq file and parameter handling is done using the 
[BMCTool](https://github.com/schuenke/BMCTool)  python package.

## Installation
For the installation of pypulseq-CEST you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. If this is the case, just
perform the following steps:

### 1) Download the code:
Clone the GitHub repository **OR** download the latest version as a 
   [ZIP file](https://github.com/KerstinHut/pypulseq-cest/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzip it into a folder.

### 2) Installation using *setup.py* file:
We provide several pre-compiled distributions of the C++ based simulation code for Linux and Windows as well as python 
versions between 3.6 and 3.9. Using these pre-compiled distributions is the recommended installation. We further 
recommend using a clean python/anaconda environment. Two convenient ways to start the automatic installation via 
*setup.py* file are:
   * Open a terminal in the _pypulseq-cest_ folder, activate your environment and execute `python setup.py`
   * Open the _pypulseq-cest_ folder in your favorite IDE (e.g. PyCharm) and run the [setup.py](setup.py) file.
     
The installation process should install the following packages into your local python environment:
   * **pySimPulseSBB**: package containing the C++ based simulation code
   * **pypulseq_cest**: package containing the python based parser functions
   * **BMCTool**: package for pulseq-cest specific seq file and config file handling
   * **pypulseq**: package for general seq file writing/reading
   * all other required packages like PyYAML, numpy, matplotlib, etc...  

### 3) Download the pulseq-cest-library:
During the installation, a folder named _**pulseq-cest-library**_ should have been created in the _**library**_ 
subfolder. If this is not the case, download the latest version as a 
[ZIP file](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and add it to the _**library**_ 
folder manually.  
   
If you run into any troubles during installation, please refer to the **Troubleshooting** section below.

## Quick Start
For an example, you can run the following from any script at any location with pypulseq_cest installed:
````python
from pypulseq_cest.simulate import sim_example

sim_example()
````

As an alternative, you can run the [simulate.py](simulate.py) file for an example simulation. The individual steps/lines are explained below.

1. Import the simulate function
````python
from pypulseq_cest.simulate import simulate
````

2.  You need a simulation configuration file in the YAML format and a sequence file in the seq format (see **Configuration and sequence file library** below). For example:
````python
sim_config = 'pypulseq_cest/example_library/config_example.yaml'
seq_file = 'pypulseq_cest/example_library/seq_example.seq'
````

2. Run the simulations with
````python
sim = simulate(config_file=sim_config, seq_file=seq_file)
````


## Configuration and sequence file library
All simulations in [pypulseq-cest](.) require a *yaml file* that includes all simulation settings and a *seq file*, which
defines the pre-saturation block. An [example seq-file](pypulseq_cest/example_library/seq_example.seq), and an [example yaml file](pypulseq_cest/example_library/config_example.seq) file can be 
found in the [library](pypulseq_cest/example_library) subfolder. 

You will find further pre-defined and approved pre-saturation schemes and simulation configs in the [pulseq-cest-library](pulseq-cest-library)
If you have not successfully used the above installation, please download it from the [pulseq-cest-library repository](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library).


## Installation Troubleshooting
To avoid permission problems, you can run the setup with administrative rights:

**Windows**: start the terminal with administrative rights
**Linux**: Depending on the environment you want to install into, use ```sudo``` or hand the ```--user``` flag like 
you would use for pip installations : 
```
sudo python setup.py
```
or
```
python setup.py --user
```
You might need to adapt your python executable, e.g. ```python3```

### System independent installation using *setup.py* file: 
If your first try to install pypulseq-cest via *setup.py* file didn't work, your system configuration is probably 
not included in the pre-compiled distributions we provide. For this case we provide a system independent installation. To
run this, please ensure that the following prerequisites are fullfilled:
1. The [BMCTool package](https://pypi.org/project/BMCTool/) has to be installed. This can be done by running
`pip install bmctool`. Using pip ensures that the required [pypulseq package](https://pypi.org/project/pypulseq/)
and [pyYaml package](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) are installed as well.
2. The following programs have to be installed on your computer:
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
   - [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/exec.html) (Installation for [Windows](http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Windows.html))
   - a working C++ compiler
     - for **Linux**, this comes with your operating system
     - for **Windows**, you need Visual C++ v.12.0 or higher, e.g. [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

If this is the case, simply re-run the *setup.py* file. This should execute all required steps including the compilation
and installation of the C++ based code. 

In the installation still didn't work, please try this [Manual Installation Guide](src/readme.md).

## FAQ: I can't get any of this to work, what shall I do?
An alternative, pure python based tool that can handle the same input is the [bmctool](https://github.com/schuenke/BMCTool).
You will find the same functionalities, but with lower performance (simulation speed).
